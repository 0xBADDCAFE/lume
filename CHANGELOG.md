## [0.17.1] - 2021-04-14
### Added
- New option `-o | --open` to open a browser automatically on serve [#62].

### Removed
- The extensions `.html.js` and `.html.ts` introduced in 0.17.0. The reason is it can be confused due not all files must generate html pages, so `.tmpl.js` / `.tmpl.ts` is more agnostic and fit all cases.

### Fixed
- Updated `postcss` version to fix a bug related with source maps.
- Updated `postcss_import` version to fix a bug related with `@charset` at-rule.

## [0.17.0] - 2021-04-11
### Added
- Show the local IP address on serve [#55]
- Allow empty front matter [#54]

- Added ability to change sort direction in `search` [#57]

### Changed
- Deprecated `permalink` variable. Use `url` instead [#46]

## [0.16.4] - 2021-03-28
### Added
- Allow to define a function as a `permalink` to generate it dynamically.
